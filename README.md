# Chess-Player-AI

A simple command-line chess AI implemented in C++ using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The program allows users to play against the AI or run performance benchmarks to evaluate the AI's search efficiency.

## Features

- **Playable Chess Game**: Play against the AI in a text-based interface.
- **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: The AI uses a depth-limited minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for move selection.
- **Board Evaluation**: Evaluates positions based on material, piece-square tables, mobility, and pawn structure.
- **Move Generation**: Supports all legal chess moves, including castling, en passant, and promotions.
- **Benchmarking**: Measures average time and nodes explored per move at various depths to assess performance.
- **Standard Chess Rules**: Fully implements chess rules, including check, checkmate, stalemate, and draw conditions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`) supporting C++11 or later
- Make (optional, for using the provided Makefile)
- Operating system: Windows, Linux, or macOS

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chess-ai.git
   cd chess-ai
   ```

2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp board.cpp chess_ai.cpp game.cpp benchmark.cpp -o chess
   ```

3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./chess
   ```

## Usage

### Playing a Game

1. Run the program to start a new game:
   ```bash
   ./chess
   ```

2. The game alternates between the human player (White by default) and the AI (Black).

3. Enter moves in algebraic notation (e.g., `e2e4` for moving a pawn from e2 to e4).

4. For promotions, append the piece type (e.g., `e7e8Q` for promoting to a queen).

5. The board is displayed after each move, with standard chess notation (a-h, 1-8).

6. The game ends with checkmate, stalemate, or a draw.

### Running the Benchmark

To evaluate the AI's performance, uncomment the `benchmark();` call in `main.cpp`:

```cpp
int main() {
    benchmark(); // Uncomment this line
    std::cout << "Starting a new game..." << std::endl;
    Game g;
    g.play();
    return 0;
}
```

Recompile and run:
```bash
make
./chess
```

The benchmark outputs average time and nodes explored per move for depths 1 to 4, helping assess search efficiency.

## File Structure

- `piece.h`: Defines Piece, Move, and GameState structs for chess pieces and moves.
- `board.h` and `board.cpp`: Implements the Board class for game state, move generation, and evaluation.
- `chess_ai.h` and `chess_ai.cpp`: Implements the ChessAI class with minimax and alpha-beta pruning.
- `game.h` and `game.cpp`: Implements the Game class for managing gameplay and user interaction.
- `benchmark.h` and `benchmark.cpp`: Implements the benchmark function for performance testing.
- `main.cpp`: Entry point, initializes the game or benchmark.
- `Makefile`: Simplifies compilation.

## Extensibility

- **Enhance Evaluation**: Modify `Board::evaluate` in `board.cpp` to include additional terms (e.g., king safety, control of center).
- **Optimize Search**: Add transposition tables or iterative deepening to `ChessAI::minimax` in `chess_ai.cpp`.
- **Add Features**: Implement puzzle evaluation, time controls, or a graphical interface.
- **Test Suites**: Integrate standard test suites (e.g., Bratko-Kopec, WAC) for tactical accuracy.
